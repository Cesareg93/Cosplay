<!--talk about the class and emotion-->

<p>I learned a lot from this class and I was able to regain some of the knowledge I once had in a prior computer class.
This class was able to teach me the coding process and something which many people find it very very frustrating, and belive me
when I say, I too find coding to be very frustrating, and yet it is something that I enjoy because it seems to always be a 
challenge in which I am willing to accept.</br></p>

<!--talk about css and java-->

<p>Before I took this class I just knew the basics of what the common tags were but after this course there is a new view on these tags
of which at one point I did not understand. At first HTML coding felt as if it was a walk in the park and then that's when the curveball 
came at me with CSS. I had never used let alone heard of css and could not understand it if my life depended on it. Yet here we are, at 
at the end of the semester and I was able to have a better understanding of what it is and how it is used in websites. It is the exact
same way with JavaScript. It is still very complicated in my eyes and I feel that I need a lot more practice with it to better understand it as well
however I do know I am able to learn it promptly.</br></p>

<!--provide examples of what I learned-->

<p>I was able to regain my knowledge on how to link sites between each other and how to make small minor changes to letters regarding their
font being <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i>. I also was able to learn more challenging items such as javascript. This was by far the hardest thing to learn
just because it is not as easy as html or css but it is helpful at making websites. In this case I decided to keep mine simple in the sense of just having the 
window pop up once this page is loaded giving you an idea as to what javascript is all about.</p>

<!--wrap it up-->

<p>At the end of the day, I do not feel as though I have accomplished what I wanted from this class because the original thought for this website was much 
bigger and more elaborate however I feel as though I was able to accomplish enough to say I am on the right track in the pursuit of my career. This has challenged
me and has made me really understand what it is really like to be a website designer. I now understand what needs to be in the website, the coding, the script and 
the attention to detail within the code to be sure that the code being used is correct and is linking correctly.</p>
