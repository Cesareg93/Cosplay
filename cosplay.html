<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Cosplay is something that many people do within the culture of gaming and superheroes.
These people dress up as their favorite characters whether it is a superhero or a villain.
They dress up and attend events such as Comic Con and FanXperience.
There are different types of conventions they are usually in attendance but gaming and 
conventions having to do with super heroes is where they are usually found. Everyone
makes their own costume and shows it off at these events. Others make them for their own benefit
because they are cosplayers who take the cosplay very serious. </p>


<!--below the schedule formatted in a list.-->

<h2><a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a></h2>
<p> These events are usually held every six months or so and they are always three (3) full days worth
of exciting events to attend and real actors who are there to see their fans for meet and greets. The typical 
days in which these events are held are the follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thursday</li>
<li>Friday</li>
<li>Saturday</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thursday's are great to get your foot in the door but the really big days seem to be Friday's and Saturday's
because that is when the main attraction of actors arrive.
