These events come from Salt Lake City FanXperience 2016. As you can see in these few examples here there are 
multiple events going on at the same time. This is why it is recommended that you take a look at the events that 
are at the convention and take a look to see what interests you and what you don't mind missing or not attending.
This is the way the event is schedule for all three (3) days during which you have this going on in rooms and outside
in the main hall you have people selling paintings, comics, books, games, accessories, toys, and collectibles.</br>
